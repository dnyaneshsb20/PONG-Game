## About the Project

**Paddle Battle** is a classic Pong-style game built using Python’s Turtle Graphics module.
The game includes two paddles, a bouncing ball, score tracking, collision detection, and a restart feature.

The aim of the project is to understand game loops, real-time movement, collision physics, and OOP concepts in Python.
This mini-game is fun, interactive, and a great way to learn how graphical games work internally.

Players control the paddles using keyboard keys:
- Right Paddle: ↑ / ↓
- Left Paddle: W / S
The first player to score 5 points wins the match.
